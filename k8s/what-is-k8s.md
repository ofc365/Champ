## what is k8s ?


K8s (short for Kubernetes) is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Kubernetes = Greek word for "helmsman" (someone who steers a ship ðŸš¢).

K8s = shorthand where the 8 stands for the eight letters between "K" and "s."

It helps you orchestrate (coordinate) a bunch of containers across a cluster of machines, making sure everything runs smoothly â€” even if some machines fail.

Kubernetes (K8s) was officially launched by Google in 2014, now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Kubernetes is mainly written in Go (also known as Golang).

`Think of it like :-`

Instead of manually running Docker containers one by one.

Kubernetes automatically handles where and how they should run, updates them, restarts if they crash, and can even scale them up or down based on traffic.



###  Why Kubernetes ?


When you have a few containers (like with Docker), itâ€™s easy to manage them by hand.

But when you have hundreds or thousands (think big apps like Instagram, Netflix), you need :-

1. Automatic restarts if something crashes

2. Load balancing traffic

3. Scaling up and down based on user demand

4. Rolling out new updates without downtime

5. Moving apps between machines if one dies


Kubernetes automates all that, It's like the conductor of a huge orchestra â€” making sure every musician (container) plays in sync.
